Project Euler 
=============

My collection of solutions to Project Euler exercises. You're welcome to help yourself to the solutions or criticise them, but please - don't use them to gain points on the PE site. It's completely out of the spirit of the project (and I'm sure there are better solutions than these).

Mostly using Python 2.7, if I have the time I'll revisit in some other language I'd like to practice more.
